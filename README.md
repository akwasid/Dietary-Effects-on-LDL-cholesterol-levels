The escalating problem of cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart disease and stroke, is an extremely important global health concern that is inextricably linked to lifestyle choices and diet. Central to this concern is the intake of foods known to elevate LDL cholesterol levels, such as those rich in trans fats and dietary cholesterol commonly found in fast food and pizza outlets. By drawing upon comprehensive investigations from a meta-analysis which encompassed over one million participants,  a relationship between elevated levels of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a rise in heart-related fatalities was shown (1).Therefore, the purpose of this research is to delve a little deeper into the impact of foods from fast food establishments and pizza outlets on LDL levels since elevated LDL levels are linked to cardiovascular health(1).
Additionally, excessive consumption of fried foods from fast food restaurants and pizza outlets significantly increases the risk of major cardiovascular events (MCEs), coronary heart disease (CHD), and heart failure(2). The significant increase in risk associated with this type of fast food demonstrates the potential adverse effects of such dietary patterns on LDL levels and, ultimately, the health of our hearts(2).Furthermore, the global epidemiology of dyslipidaemia by Pirillo et al. (2021)  provided further evidence of the escalating prevalence of dyslipidemias exacerbated by urban lifestyles and 'Western' dietary trends(3). Moreover, individuals diagnosed with diabetes or metabolic syndrome frequently exhibit atherogenic dyslipidaemia, which is characterized by elevated triglyceride levels, decreased HDL-cholesterol levels, and the presence of compact, small LDL particles in increased amounts(3).
This review provided insights into the intricate relationship between dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus, shedding light on the growing risk of atherogenic dyslipidemia, especially among individuals with diabetes(3).Expanding upon such significant discoveries, our research hypothesizes a direct correlation between the quantity of food consumed at fast food establishments and pizza outlets and levels of LDL cholesterol among adults aged 12 to 100 who participated in the NHANES 2015–2016 study. The age range was chosen based on the criteria of the NHANES 2015–2016 study to only take the LDL levels of participants 12-100 years and also to document everyone 80+ as 80 (4,5). This investigation aims to shed light on dietary components that contribute to elevated LDL and hence, with any luck, influence the implementation of prudent health policies that mitigate this escalating issue.
